        <h1 class="mytitle">Sophomore Year and Beyond</h1> 
        <div class="bodytext">
            <p>When I originally arrived at BYU I had my heart set on becoming an orthodontist, 
                but though a series of experiences I decided to pursue a degree in finance.
                As anyone who looks at my resume can see I tried a lot of different interships
                trying to figure out what I would like best. I did internships in strategy,
                investment banking, venture capital, private equity, and growth equity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Eventually I settled on growth equity. The summer of 2022 I had the good fortune
                to intern with a great firm, M33 Growth. I accepted an offer to return there as 
                an analyst after graduation. Right now I am no expert but I can offer a few suggestions and steps
                for anyone starting to look into a career in finance.
            </p>

                    <li class="subheaders">Research Different Career Paths</li>
                        <p> There are a lot of different career paths in finance. I will primarily 
                            highlight careers that fall into either the buy side or the sell side of finance.
                            Sell side careers are in investment banking. Buy side careers are in venture captial,
                            growth equity, private equity, hedge funds, and more. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I first started diving into the world of finance all of these career choices seemed
                            daunting and I didn't know the difference between each one. I'll give a brief summary of
                            each one to help you. 
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Investment Banking: Investment bankers help sell companies or help them raise
                                        capital. Investment bankers typically work very long hours and spend their 
                                        time in excel, powerpoint, and other applications to get the deal done.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Venture Capital: Venture capitalists invest in startup companies. They help 
                                        new companies fund their growth. They typically work long hours as well and 
                                        spend time looking for companies to fund.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Growth Equity: Growth equity investors play a role very similar to venture 
                                        capitalists. They also fund companies, but these companies are no longer
                                        just an idea. They have achieved significant traction and growth investors 
                                        help professionalize the business and take it to the next level.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Private Equity: Private equity investors invest in mature, profitable companies
                                        who are probably growing a little slower. Their focus is on helping the company
                                        increase its profit margin to squeeze as much cash out of the business as possible.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Hedge Funds: Hedge fund managers invest in companies on the stock market. They 
                                        can also invest in various other financial instruments with the goal of beating the 
                                        market return.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>
                    <li class="subheaders">Leverage Your School's Resources</li>
                        <p>
                            Every school has an alumni network. I recommend reaching out to alumni from your school 
                            in your desired career path. They can help you with recruiting, interview processes, and
                            can introduce you to more people.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Additionally, lots of schools have access to research tools through their library. Use these
                            because they can be very expensive to purchase on your own. Take advantage while you are in school.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another great school resource is clubs. If your school has a club in your area of interest you should
                            join and be an active member. This can help you get to know other students in a similar situation to yourself
                            and you can help each other.
                        </p>
                    <li class="subheaders">Hustle, Hustle, Hustle</li>
                        <p>
                            I cannot stress this part enough. A job in one of the industries I mentioned above does not
                            come without a lot of hard work. You need to allocate time to do industry research, network, 
                            and apply for positions. This all is on top of school and work so you need to make sure you 
                            are willing to make the sacrifice of time and energy. There may be times you pass up the 
                            opportunity to hang out with friends to study, hone technical skills, or attend a club meeting.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your hustle will be recognized. I believe there is an opportunity in all of the career paths
                            previously mentioned for people that work hard.
                        </p>
                    <li class="subheaders">Prepare for Interviews</li>
                    <img class="img" src="../assets/img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="handshake after interview">
                        <p>
                            Interview preparation can be one of the toughest parts and each industry interviews a little
                            differently. Here are a few suggestions you can take to prepare for an interview with a buyside
                            firm.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Come prepared with information about a portfolio company of the firm you are
                                        applying to. They may ask you to talk about one of their companies and having a company
                                        ready to discuss can give you a leg up on other applicants.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Come ready to pitch a deal. They may ask you about a company you've been following that 
                                        had a recent transaction. If you can talk about a deal that fits their investment criteria
                                        you will have shown to your interviewer that you understand the firm well and could help 
                                        them source.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Come with a thesis about an industry. Industries go through cycles and some are more 
                                        attractive than others. Pitch them an industry that you think would be a good fit for them.
                                        Do plenty of research ahead of time to present a well thought out argument of why it is an 
                                        attractive industry. Podcasts can be an especially great resource to assist in research.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Stay up to date. Being current on world events and industry events is very important, but 
                                        not that hard. I recommend subscribing to email newsletters that will update you every day.
                                        Other great resources are podcasts and news sites. 
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                        </p>
                </ol>
                Overall there are a lot of paths you can take. Feel free to reach out to me for any more advice if needed.
